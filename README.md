# **Developing and testing an elastic-net logistic regression immune cell classifier**

This repository supplies the code developed in the study of Torang _et al._ **_"An elastic-net logistic regression approach to generate classifiers and gene signatures for types of immune cells and T helper cell subsets"_**. It can be used to reproduce the results of the study and investigate the methodology to be used for other datasets.

## **Requirements**

* R version 3.4.0 -- "You Stupid Darkness").
* R libraries: dplyr, annotables, EDASeq, glmnet, DescTools, matlab, tidyverse, plotrix, MASS, plyr, rafalib, factoextra, NbClust, Matrix, pROC, xlsx, MESS, ggplot2

## **Data**

All necessary data is provided in the "Files" folder of the repository or can be found at: TODO. Sourcing for all data can be found in Torang _et al._

## **Quick start**

To reproduce the results, download the relevant script and load the corresponding data into the R workspace. Running the script will generate all relevant figures and data tables for the given portion of the study.

# General notes

The code provided in this repository reproduces the main results of the study of Torang _et al._ **_"An elastic-net logistic regression approach to generate classifiers and gene signatures for types of immune cells and T helper cell subsets"_** but it is not meant as a self-contained module for use in further analysis.
